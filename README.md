This is atest of the emergency coding system. All attempts to abort coding will result in denial of the ability to distort time and space.
Testing of github editing the readme.  The files produced will be used to make the good ol' 'Hello World' program that is time-revered amongst those who actually code. It must have started sometime in the earliest days of computing, the earliest requests to produce a bit of code for the new students in a programming course, possibly using 'punch cards.'
I'm guessing the 60's, as 50's seems a bit too early for Hello World.  A 'bot' could, nowadays, likely produce better and more relvant prose than I am currently.  However, would a programmed machine ever out-do a programmed human in the witticism department of Thrills-R-Us?  I doubt it as much as I doubt that you are actually reading this.  Your're imagining this.  Maybe.  Or maybe not. Maybe you CAN read this. Can you?  Are you there? Neo?

Ok, so its been 29 years since the first RRTYSHSHS.  If you don't know what that is 'Schmugle it.'
